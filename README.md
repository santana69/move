#### Description

This is a simple app that displays a list of different items (books, phones, and cars).

Our objects (Book, Phone, and Car) inherit from object Thing, such that they can share the following properties: name, description, image. For simplicity, the image is a simple icon.

Each object has two additional properties, such that we have different information unique to that class.
